I am a senior undergraduate student in Mathamatics & Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am now fortunated to be working in CoAI Lab@THU advised by <a href="http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml">Prof. Minlie Huang</a> and in Tencent WXG AI Lab.

My current research area is in Language/Text Generation and Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and Dialogue System. And my exploration interests lie in the intersections of general Machine Learning theory, Natural Language Processing and Data Mining.

Feel free to drop me an e-mail if you are interested in my research and want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
