I am a Senior undergraduate student in Mathamatics & Computer Science at <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a>. I am now fortunated to be working in <a href="https://ai.tencent.com/">Tencent AI Lab</a>@WXG and <a href="http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">CoAI Lab@THU</a> advised by Prof. <a href="http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml">Minlie Huang</a>.

My current research area is in Natural Language Generation(NLG), Deep Learning for NLP and Dialogue System. 
And my exploration interests lie in the intersections of Interpretable Machine Learning, NLP and Data Mining.

Feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}">e-mail</a> if you are interested in my research and want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations.
